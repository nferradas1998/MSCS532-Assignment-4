Report on priority queue

For the implementation of the priority queue I decided to use an array to represent the data structure.
There are multiple reasons as to why I thought this was the most appropriate decision

1. Efficient Insertion and Extraction
- Because arrays have indeces for the values stored, it provides an efficient way to insert and extract values from the array, hence
    improving the performance of its main operaitons.

2. Cache efficiency
- Arrays always have better cache locality which means that the have better use of the CPU, which improves performance when accessing the CPU

3. Optimized memory use
- Arrays are just continous blocks of memory, and so there is no need to have pointers for blocks that are not contigous. This means that
    there is no need for maintaining pointers and creating memory overload.
